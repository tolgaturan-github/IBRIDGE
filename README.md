## INTRODUCTION:

Quantification of T cell infiltration levels in a tumor tissue, is an important component of Immuno-Oncology research. In bulk gene expression datasets, this can be approximated by using "Gene Set Enrichment" or "Cell Type Deconvolution" methods (with gene signatures such as ICR, TIS or IFNG, etc. ). However, reaching the same goal is not straigthforward in single-cell RNAseq datasets. Here, we report a novel method "iBRIDGE" that can integrate and *bridge* between bulk and single-cell gene expression data types to quantify T cell infiltration levels and classify the patients as "inflamed", "cold" or "unassignedintermediate".
